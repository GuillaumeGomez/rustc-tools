<h2 id="motivation"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#motivation">§</a>Motivation</h2>
<p>MIR building can insert a lot of redundant copies, and Rust code in general often tends to move
values around a lot. The result is a lot of assignments of the form <code>dest = {move} src;</code> in MIR.
MIR building for constants in particular tends to create additional locals that are only used
inside a single block to shuffle a value around unnecessarily.</p>
<p>LLVM by itself is not good enough at eliminating these redundant copies (eg. see
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32966">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32966</a>), so this leaves some performance on the table
that we can regain by implementing an optimization for removing these assign statements in rustc
itself. When this optimization runs fast enough, it can also speed up the constant evaluation
and code generation phases of rustc due to the reduced number of statements and locals.</p>
<h2 id="the-optimization"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#the-optimization">§</a>The Optimization</h2>
<p>Conceptually, this optimization is “destination propagation”. It is similar to the Named Return
Value Optimization, or NRVO, known from the C++ world, except that it isn’t limited to return
values or the return place <code>_0</code>. On a very high level, independent of the actual implementation
details, it does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify <code>dest = src;</code> statements with values for <code>dest</code> and <code>src</code> whose storage can soundly
be merged.</li>
<li>Replace all mentions of <code>src</code> with <code>dest</code> (“unifying” them and propagating the destination
backwards).</li>
<li>Delete the <code>dest = src;</code> statement (by making it a <code>nop</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1) is by far the hardest, so it is explained in more detail below.</p>
<h3 id="soundness"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#soundness">§</a>Soundness</h3>
<p>We have a pair of places <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>, whose memory we would like to merge. In order for this to
be sound, we need to check a number of conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>p</code> and <code>q</code> must both be <em>constant</em> - it does not make much sense to talk about merging them
if they do not consistently refer to the same place in memory. This is satisfied if they do
not contain any indirection through a pointer or any indexing projections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>p</code> and <code>q</code> must have the <strong>same type</strong>. If we replace a local with a subtype or supertype,
we may end up with a different vtable for that local. See the <code>subtyping-impacts-selection</code>
tests for an example where that causes issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to make sure that the goal of “merging the memory” is actually structurally possible
in MIR. For example, even if all the other conditions are satisfied, there is no way to
“merge” <code>_5.foo</code> and <code>_6.bar</code>. For now, we ensure this by requiring that both <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are
locals with no further projections. Future iterations of this pass should improve on this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we want <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> to use the same memory - however, we still need to make sure that
each of them has enough “ownership” of that memory to continue “doing its job.” More
precisely, what we will check is that whenever the program performs a write to <code>p</code>, then it
does not currently care about what the value in <code>q</code> is (and vice versa). We formalize the
notion of “does not care what the value in <code>q</code> is” by checking the <em>liveness</em> of <code>q</code>.</p>
<p>Because of the difficulty of computing liveness of places that have their address taken, we do
not even attempt to do it. Any places that are in a local that has its address taken is
excluded from the optimization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two conditions are simple structural requirements on the <code>Assign</code> statements that can
be trivially checked. The third requirement however is more difficult and costly to check.</p>
<h3 id="future-improvements"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#future-improvements">§</a>Future Improvements</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways in which this pass could be improved in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Merging storage liveness ranges instead of removing storage statements completely. This may
improve stack usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow merging locals into places with projections, eg <code>_5</code> into <code>_6.foo</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liveness analysis with more precision than whole locals at a time. The smaller benefit of this
is that it would allow us to dest prop at “sub-local” levels in some cases. The bigger benefit
of this is that such liveness analysis can report more accurate results about whole locals at
a time. For example, consider:</p>

<div class="example-wrap ignore"><a href="#" class="tooltip" title="This example is not tested">ⓘ</a><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code>_1 = u;
<span class="comment">// unrelated code
</span>_1.f1 = v;
_2 = _1.f1;</code></pre></div>
<p>Because the current analysis only thinks in terms of locals, it does not have enough
information to report that <code>_1</code> is dead in the “unrelated code” section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liveness analysis enabled by alias analysis. This would allow us to not just bail on locals
that ever have their address taken. Of course that requires actually having alias analysis
(and a model to build it on), so this might be a bit of a ways off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various perf improvements. There are a bunch of comments in here marked <code>PERF</code> with ideas for
how to do things more efficiently. However, the complexity of the pass as a whole should be
kept in mind.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="previous-work"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#previous-work">§</a>Previous Work</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47954">previous attempt</a> at implementing an optimization like this turned out to be a
significant regression in compiler performance. Fixing the regressions introduced a lot of
undesirable complexity to the implementation.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71003">subsequent approach</a> tried to avoid the costly computation by limiting itself to
acyclic CFGs, but still turned out to be far too costly to run due to suboptimal performance
within individual basic blocks, requiring a walk across the entire block for every assignment
found within the block. For the <code>tuple-stress</code> benchmark, which has 458745 statements in a
single block, this proved to be far too costly.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/72632">Another approach after that</a> was much closer to correct, but had some soundness
issues - it was failing to consider stores outside live ranges, and failed to uphold some of the
requirements that MIR has for non-overlapping places within statements. However, it also had
performance issues caused by <code>O(l² * s)</code> runtime, where <code>l</code> is the number of locals and <code>s</code> is
the number of statements and terminators.</p>
<p>Since the first attempt at this, the compiler has improved dramatically, and new analysis
frameworks have been added that should make this approach viable without requiring a limited
approach that only works for some classes of CFGs:</p>
<ul>
<li>rustc now has a powerful dataflow analysis framework that can handle forwards and backwards
analyses efficiently.</li>
<li>Layout optimizations for coroutines have been added to improve code generation for
async/await, which are very similar in spirit to what this optimization does.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, rustc now has a simple NRVO pass (see <code>nrvo.rs</code>), which handles a subset of the cases that
this destination propagation pass handles, proving that similar optimizations can be performed
on MIR.</p>
<h3 id="prepost-optimization"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#prepost-optimization">§</a>Pre/Post Optimization</h3>
<p>It is recommended to run <code>SimplifyCfg</code> and then <code>SimplifyLocals</code> some time after this pass, as
it replaces the eliminated assign statements with <code>nop</code>s and leaves unused locals behind.</p>
